      <h3>Developing your first application</h3>
      <p>After installing Sailor and generating your app, it's time to start developing! Sailor follows the MVC design pattern, so this basic tutorial will follow a typical but simplified workflow for this design and explain how to create a model, a controller and a view. For details or advanced use of Sailor, please check the reference manual.
